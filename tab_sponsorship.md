### OWASP Meeting Presenter Sponsorship ### 

Although the OWASP Foundation is a non-profit organization and our Algiers Chapter is a non-profit organization, we strive to provide our members with the best presenters we possibly can. While the Algeria area has tons of security talent, sometimes it's worthwhile to reach beyond our borders to pull in more awesome presenters. In exchange for covering travel expenses for these presenters, our chapter will provide you with 5 minutes talk at the start of the meeting to introduce yourself and company to tell us about the products or services that your company offers. You'll also receive mention of being the presenter sponsor in all e-mail communications about the meeting and the company will be included as a sponsor in all official communications of the chapter.
